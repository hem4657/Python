The error you're seeing:

```
error: src refspec main does not match any
```

means that the local branch `main` does not exist, so Git has nothing to push.

---

### ‚úÖ Here's how you can fix it step by step:

#### 1. **Check your current branch**

Run this command:

```bash
git branch
```

You might see something like:

```
* master
```

or another branch name. If you see `master` or something else instead of `main`, that‚Äôs why the error occurred.

#### 2. **Rename the branch to `main`** *(Optional but recommended if GitHub expects `main`)*

If you want to rename your current branch to `main`:

```bash
git branch -m main
```

#### 3. **Push to GitHub**

Now push the renamed branch:

```bash
git push -u origin main --force
```

---

### üîç Alternatively: Just push the existing branch

If you don't want to rename the branch, just push the current one (e.g. `master`):

```bash
git push -u origin master --force
```

---

### üí° Bonus Tip: Check remote branch names

If you're unsure which branches exist on GitHub:

```bash
git ls-remote origin
```

---

Let me know if you want to create a new `main` branch or stick with `master`.
